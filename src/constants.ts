Ghost detects all text and shape layers (i.e., rectangles, ellipses, vectors, frames, etc.) selected. It then measures their dimensions before replacing them with rectangles; the original layers are removed. To generate a layout faithful to the original, Ghost removes auto-layout, thereby preventing some of the anomalies that occur when inserting children into frames. Basic Usage. Select a shape, text box, or an entire screen.Select a color. Ghost!',
